# About Me

Hi! ðŸ‘‹ My name is **Krzysztof Fila** and I focus on **pentesting, web application security, and exploit development**.  

On this website, I document:
- CTF solutions (HackTheBox, TryHackMe, VulnHub),
- vulnerability analyses and CVEs,
- my labs and personal projects,
- as well as blog posts about security research.

ðŸŽ¯ My goal is to grow in **red teaming and penetration testing** and achieve certifications like **OSCP and CPTS**.
